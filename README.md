# CombinatorialOptimAlgorithms

Project written in Java, consisting in the implementation of a class hierarchy associated with different types of graphs, as well as the implementation of advanced algorithms drawn from combinatorial optimization.

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm for solving the maximum value flow problem is currently being implemented.
